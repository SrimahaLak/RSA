# Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) Algorithm Implementation in Python

The **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)** algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic technique used for secure data transmission. It uses a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.

This project contains a basic implementation of the RSA algorithm in Python, including:

- 🔑 **Key generation** – Generate public and private keys  
- 🔐 **Encryption** – Encrypt plaintext using the public key  
- 🔓 **Decryption** – Decrypt ciphertext using the private key  

It's a simple demonstration of how the RSA Algorithm works using core Python logic.
