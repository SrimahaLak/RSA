# Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) Algorithm Implementation in Python 


The Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic technique used for secure data transmission. It uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

This project contains a basic implementation of the RSA algorithm in Python, including:
- Key generation
- Encryption
- Decryption

It's a simple demonstration of how RSA works using core Python logic.
